# GasMoney
Attempting a project where I can see how much to charge people for rides based on how much gas was used. I'm using an OBD2 reader in my car to generate a csv file of a bunch of location points all seperated by a little less than a second. I download that, put it in my program, and it tells me how much that trip cost me gas wise.
